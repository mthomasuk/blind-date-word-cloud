# Blind Date Word Cloud

### What

I scraped every article from The Guardian's Blind Date series and turned the "describe x in three words" into a word cloud

### Why

Because shut up

### How

Python, and some pretty stodgy, un-performant and crappily implemented Python at that

### Was it easy

You betcha
